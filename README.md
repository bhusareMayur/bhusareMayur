# Hi, I’m Mayur Bhusare

I’m a backend-focused Computer Engineering student interested in building reliable, scalable systems and understanding how they behave under real-world constraints.

Most of my learning comes from building and reasoning about systems rather than just coursework.

---

## What I work on

- Backend APIs using Node.js and Express
- Asynchronous systems using message queues
- Database design and data flow
- System reliability (retries, idempotency, failure handling)
- Core DSA and system fundamentals

---

## Featured Projects

### Scalable Multi-Channel Notification System
**Tech:** Node.js, RabbitMQ, Docker, MySQL  

- Built an asynchronous notification service supporting Email / SMS / Push
- Used message queues with workers for decoupled processing
- Implemented retries with Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
- Designed idempotent consumers to avoid duplicate delivery
- Added structured logging for failures and retries
- Designed for horizontal scaling and fault tolerance

### NAMASTE ↔ ICD-11 Mapping Platform
**Tech:** Node.js (Express), Python (Flask), NLP, REST APIs, FHIR  

- Built a backend system to map traditional medicine terms to ICD-11 standards
- Implemented semantic search using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Generated FHIR-compliant outputs for healthcare interoperability
- Designed as a microservice-based architecture

## Experience

**Full-Stack Developer — Lagnify (Freelance)**  
- Built and deployed a production web platform used by real customers
- Worked on backend workflows, admin systems, and deployment
- Handled debugging, feature iteration, and system maintenance

---

## Technical Skills (Brief)

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Java, C++, Python  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs  
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB  
- **Messaging & Infra:** RabbitMQ, Docker  
- **Cloud (Basics):** AWS EC2, S3  
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, Postman  

---

## Problem Solving

- Solved 350+ DSA problems (LeetCode, GFG, CodeStudio)
- Comfortable explaining trade-offs and approaches

---

I’m interested in backend / systems-focused internship roles where correctness, clarity, and reliability matter.
